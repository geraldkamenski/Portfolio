									<p>Manufacturing, Assembly, and Instrumentation of Miniature Jet Engine</p>
								</header>

								<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>This project started as a curiosity driven with the initial goal being to simply build a small scale rocket style engine for fun. But this quickly evolved into a more instrumentation focused experiment. Instead of stopping at a working engine, the project expanded to include data collection, efficiency analysis, and system level design choices similar to what would be done in a formal propulsion test environment.<br />
									By treating the engine as both a mechanical system and a test platform, this project became an opportunity to explore how propulsion concepts like the Brayton cycle translate into a real, imperfect, and measurable system.</p>
								
								<h2>Goal</h2>
									<p>The primary objective of this project was to design, manufacture, assemble, and operate a miniature jet engine while collecting meaningful performance data, such as the thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC).</p>
								<h2>System Overview</h2>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/#" alt="" /></div>
									<p>The final system is a fully assembled and instrumented multi stage turbojet engine integrated into a dedicated testbed for controlled operation and performance measurement. The engine operates on an open Brayton cycle, drawing in ambient air, compressing it through multiple compressor stages, combusting a fuel air mixture, and expanding the flow through the turbine to generate thrust.<br />
									Fuel delivery is controlled manually using a regulator and control valve, allowing precise adjustment of combustion intensity. A high voltage spark system powered by an external supply initiates combustion, while a starter motor, mechanically coupled to the turbine nozzle via a keyed interface, accelerates the rotating assembly during startup until reaching self-sustaining functionality.<br />
									The machined jet engine assembly consists of multiple compressor stages followed by a combustion chamber and turbine section, forming a compact propulsion unit. Air is drawn into the front compressor stages, directed outward toward the combustion chamber, and expanded through the turbine before exiting the exhaust to produce thrust. Once ignition is sustained, the turbine becomes self driven and no longer requires external mechanical input.<br />
									Instrumentation is integrated into the system and connected to a host computer for real time data acquisition and analysis. Thrust and fuel mass measurements are collected and streamed live, enabling calculation of performance metrics such as TSFC during operation.<br />
									All components are mounted to a custom testbed that maintains alignment, reduces measurement interference, and improves operational safety. The testbed structurally supports the engine, fuel system, and instrumentation while providing physical separation between hot components and fuel storage.</p>

									<p>An exploded CAD model was developed to verify component fitment, mounting interfaces, and serviceability prior to fabrication. Material choices and component placement were driven by center of gravity and center of buoyancy considerations to ensure stable operation underwater. The mechanical layout was validated through assembly and static testing before full system integration.</p>
